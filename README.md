## Abstract
This thesis investigates the ability to identify inflammation flares and other clinical va-
riables through heart rate data in patients with psoriatic arthritis.
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects the joints
andskin, causingpain, stiffness, andgeneralmalaise. Duringflareperiods, symptomscan
beparticularlysevere, significantlyimpactingpatients’qualityoflife. Earlyidentification
or prediction of these flares could lead to more effective symptom management.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in time between consecutive
heartbeats and reflects the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Low HRV values
have been associated with inflammatory conditions and physiological dysfunction, ma-
king it a promising biomarker for monitoring chronic diseases. With modern wearable
technology (smartwatches, rings), continuous and non-invasive heart rate monitoring in
daily life is now possible.

In this study, data from 111 patients across Europe were collected via smartwatch. The
raw heart rate data underwent preprocessing to extract reliable HRV metrics. Subseque-
ntly, statistical analysis and machine learning techniques were applied to investigate both
the discriminative and predictive ability of HRV features with respect to inflammation
flares, as well as additional clinical variables of the disease.
